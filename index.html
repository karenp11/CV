    <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
    <UL>
        <li><h4>Glasgow Caledonian University – Glasgow – B.Sc.(Hons) Podiatry – 2:1</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Studying helped me further my skills when using Microsoft Office packages as they were regularly used throughout my years of studying in various guises.  It also helped me hone my learning capabilities to such an extent that I consider myself an extremely fast learner.  My excellent organisational skills were mainly developed at university due to vast reliance on self study and the need to work to certain deadlines.  It was there that the importance of time management was most evident</li>
            <li>Decided to change careers due to the effects of the recession and the lack of funding in the NHS for Podiatry positions.  Continuing as self employed was not financially viable given the state of the economy and given the lack of roles in the NHS, I took the decision to transfer my skills to another career path where I have remained happily since</li>
